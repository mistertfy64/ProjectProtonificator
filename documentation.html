      While it was/is planned, mistertfy64 hasn't had the time to actually implement saving in the browser's local storage.

      Due to "tight" time constraints (i.e., 15 weeks), there isn't that enough time to implement many planned features.
      Especially while the group members are juggling other courses as well. Expect incomplete and/or broken features.

    <!-- About -->
    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    ProjectProtonificator is an incremental game where the main premise is to have as much money, electricity and particles as possible.
    Just like other incremental games, after generating currencies, the player can use currencies to purchase "upgrades" to increase the production of the same/similar currencies.
    <br><br>
    The game can be played at <a href="https://content.mistertfy64.com/ProjectProtonificator">https://content.mistertfy64.com/ProjectProtonificator</a>.
    <!-- Basic Gameplay -->
    <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
    <h3 id="gameplay__getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
    When the player first opens the game, the game will present a picture of a "particle-generating" machine, and two buttons below it. While the particle-generating machine is part of the game,
    it only serves as decoration.
    <br><br>
    When nothing is pressed, the game generates electricity at a base rate of 1 electricity per second.
    <br><br>
    The red POWER button can be pressed and held down. When the red POWER button is pressed and held down for at least 3 seconds, particles will start generating at a base rate of 1 electricity person if the player has electricity remaining.
    While particles are being generated, electricity will be deducted (because it was used to generate the particles).
    <br><br>
    The green SELL button can be pressed, but not held down. When the green SELL button is pressed, particles will be converted to money at a rate of 1 particle to 1 money.
    Note that the conversion happens for all generated particles, so there really is no need to hold down the green SELL button.
    <!-- Upgrades -->
    <h3 id="gameplay__upgrades">Upgrades</h3>
    With enough money, upgrades can be bought.
    Once bought, upgrades are permanent (to an extent) and are immediately activated and require no further action.
    Upgrades do what the description state.
    Additionally, upgrades can only be bought up to a certain amount of times as stated by the number behind the slash.
    <br><br>
    The first upgrade from the top (Upgrade s1) claims to increase game speed. While that isn't 100% true, it does increase the speed of time as if time really passed faster so more resources are generated.
    This upgrade does not affect how fast the new numbers display after change, but rather (technically) how fast they change.
    <br><br>
    The fourth upgrade from the top's (Upgrade p3) formula is (electricity+level)^0.125+1
    <br><br>
    The fifth upgrade from the top's (Upgrade p4) formula is (electricity+level)^0.0875+1
    <br><br>
    The sixth upgrade from the top's (Upgrade po) formula unlocks the next feature.
    <!-- Overload -->
    <h3 id="gameplay__overload">Overload</h3>
    Once upgrade po is bought, the player can perform an Overload. Performing an Overload is irreversible and will reset the player's upgrade (except for upgrade po), and currencies for a new currency: overloaded generator scraps.
    Additional upgrades can be bought using overloaded generator scraps.
    <br><br>
    How much overload generator scraps you gain depends on how much money you have at the time of reset.
    <br><br>
    The formula for overload generator scrap gain on reset is: (money/10^7)^0.5, but it is important to note that when resetting, but the player needs at least 1 overload generator scrap on reset to be able to reset.
    <!-- Settings -->
    <h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
    In the settings menu, there are two buttons: "Export Save Data" and "Import Save Data".
    <br><br>
    To save your game state, hit "Export Save Data".
    The game will give a string that the player should store somewhere safe.
    To load the game state, hit "Import Save Data" and use the string obtained from the "Export Save Data" button.
    <br><br>
    Note that at the time of writing, there is no autosave/load function yet.

    <!-- Technical Details -->
    <h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
    <h3 id="technical-details__source-code">Source Code</h3>
    The source code can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/mistertfy64/ProjectProtonificator">https://github.com/mistertfy64/ProjectProtonificator</a>.
    <h3 id="technical-details__large-numbers">Large Numbers</h3>
    (Vanilla) JavaScript can only handle numbers as large as 2^1024 ≈ 1.79*10^308. After the limit, the number is displayed as "Infinity", and will break calculations.
    With many multiplicative multipliers (e.g., 309 multipliers of x10 would already exceed the limit), one can expect numbers to go further than the limit.
    <br><br>
    Because of that, the game uses a special JavaScript library called <a href="https://github.com/Patashu/break_eternity.js/">break_eternity.js</a>, which can "represent numbers as large as 10^^1e308".
    Further technical implementation details of break_eternity.js can be found in its README.
    <h3 id="technical-details__html-manipulation">HTML Manipulation</h3>
    As this is a game with many "screens", code is needed to switch between the screens. The way this game used is to animate show and hide with durations of 0 milliseconds (i.e., instantly).
    This can be done with traditional methods (e.g., document.getElementById("foo").style.display = "none";), but it can be seen that the code is too long.
    <br><br>
    Because of that, the game uses a <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, which "makes things like HTML [...] manipulation, [...] simpler [...]".
    The primary reason why mistertfy64 chose to use jQuery is that "it makes the code shorter" (e.g., document.getElementById("foo") ≈ $("#foo") in jQuery).
    <h3 id="technical-details__save-string">Save String</h3>
    This game uses Base64 encoding/decoding to encode/decode save data. There are native functions that deal with Base64 in JavaScript.
    <span style="opacity:0.075">This also means that one could make fake save data and then trick the game to think its real, which mistertfy64 has already done for testing purposes.</span>
